## Robodex
This is basically a pokedex/rolodex, but for robots. It has a card grid UI with robot images and user info pulled from two separate APIs. The main dashboard displays all robots and a search bar. The search component listens to the state to retrieve robots that match your typing on demand.

## Motivation
To practice React, Redux, state management.
